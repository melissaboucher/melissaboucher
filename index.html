			<h1>I'm interested in tools that help us to see, understand, and think. </h1>

			<p>
				I design software in San Francisco. Sometimes I make dances and draw letterforms. Through these practices I seek to understand how sensory modalities help us to create and learn. I love helping others find their creativity.

				<h2>My journey</h2>
				<p>
					Currently I’m a product design manager at <a href="http://www.looker.com">Looker</a>, leading a team on the core business intelligence tools. We help companies ask questions of their data so they can make better decisions. We think about telling stories with data and making data easy to access and understand. As much as I care about what we build together, I’m interested in the humanity of how we work together.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was an early product designer at <a href="http://www.coda.io">Coda</a>, where we invented a flexible new type of document, lovingly referred to as the “Minecraft for docs” by an early user. We made docs feel more like apps and aimed to equip a new generation of makers. I was awarded a couple of patents along the way.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before joining early-stage startups, I built an online marketplace at <a href="http://www.zazzle.com">Zazzle</a> and designed custom goods for brands like Harry Potter and Star Wars. During graduate school, I partnered with a robotics lab to design and develop a Brain-Computer-Interface application that would enable mobility-impaired people to read on mobile devices.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've studied Systems Engineering at the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>, Industrial Engineering and Human Factors and Ergonomics at <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu">San Jose State University</a>, and Typography with the <a href="http://www.sva.edu">School of Visual Arts</a>.
				</p>
					<p>Once I was a medical student who, midway through long hours in the anatomy lab, realized it was never too late to start over.
